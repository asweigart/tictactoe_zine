# tictactoe_zine
Code that generates a Choose Your Own Adventure tic tac toe game to be printed as a zine. This is a silly project.

# This is a silly project.

Tic tac toe is a simple game. Making a tic tac toe program isn't an advanced coding task. But I wanted to create a physical object that demonstrated the vast-but-mundane amount of calculation computers do. Creating this zine with pen and paper would take months of effort. But a few hours of coding (and a few more days of tinkering and layout adjustment to appease my perfectionism) can produce a PDF that turns my home laser printer, paper cutter, and stapler into a cottage print shop.

And I can share the PDF on the internet with people around the world for free, along with the program that produced it. It's an interesting thing that people can hold in their hands, and it might strike the curiosity of some of those people to learn how to code.

This is why I love programming; it enables us to follow up on our silly little creative impulses and share our creations with the world.

TODO - insert photos of zine

# Making the Zine from the PDF

To make the zine, print out tictactoe_zine.pdf on US letter sized paper, duplexed on the long end (the long end is default).

Be sure to not cut the centerfold image. It needs to be the full half-sheet. Also, leave it unfolded when stapling.

TODO - add more steps and photos of the process.

# The Code

To generate tictactoe_zine.pdf, run make_ttt_zine.py. You'll need the .png image files in the same folder. You'll need to have Pillow and PyPDF installed.
