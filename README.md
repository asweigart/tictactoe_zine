# tictactoe_zine
Code that generates a Choose Your Own Adventure tic tac toe game to be printed as a zine. This is a silly project.

# This is a silly project.

Tic tac toe is a simple game. Making a tic tac toe program isn't an advanced coding task. But I wanted to create a physical object that demonstrated the vast-but-mundane amount of calculation computers do. Creating this zine with pen and paper would take months of effort. But a few hours of coding (and a few more days of tinkering and layout adjustment to appease my perfectionism) can produce a PDF that turns my home laser printer, paper cutter, and stapler into a cottage print shop.

And I can share the PDF on the internet with people around the world for free, along with the program that produced it. It's an interesting thing that people can hold in their hands, and it might strike the curiosity of some of those people to learn how to code.

This is why I love programming; it enables us to follow up on our silly little creative impulses and share our creations with the world.
